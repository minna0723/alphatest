# How to likability test

Just one second until likability diagnosis

In fact, when we judge the likability, everything can be done at the first meeting.

In fact, according to the results of a study by psychologists, it is said that one second determines the degree of favorability for the other person, and most of the time, it enters the stage of certainty.

Of course, there are people who don't get along with me and people who don't get along with me, but you all know that if you don't even get the first step right, it's hard to meet again.

How do you diagnose the likelihood of a first encounter that is determined in one second?

We'll talk about it below.


## likability test with AI

You can diagnose favorability through learned AI and artificial intelligence.

You don't have to take this result seriously.

Click the link below to test and diagnose favorability.

But keep in mind in mind.

AI and artificial intelligence also judge likability differently depending on the atmosphere and expression, but it will be difficult to be within the range of favor with each other if they are uncomfortable in meeting or contact with the other person.
