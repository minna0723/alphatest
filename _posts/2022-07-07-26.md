# AI likeability test from Running Man

I will tell you how to test the AI likeability introduced in episode 610 of Running Man.

<a href="https://alphaface-ai.com/likeabilitytest/"> "Going to test for AI likeability test"</a>

Anyone can enjoy it at the link above.

You can meet ai that is 100% trained on Google's teachable machine.

## Points to Note 1

We don't have to take the results seriously, but we made it to provide fun and enjoyment, so it would be good to enjoy it once in a while.

Check accuracy by sharing results.

## Points to Note 2

Artificial intelligence only evaluates the likability of 'appearance', you can smile once and pay attention to curiosity.

However, the affinity evaluation of the alpha face extracts results by judging the atmosphere and the expression of the evaluator.

Artificial intelligence is also evaluated with atmosphere and expression, and it should be known as basic common sense that atmosphere and expression, which are the criteria for evaluating in real human relationships, are one of the big evaluation factors.

## Points to Note 3

AlphaFace utilizes AI learned from Google's teachable machine and does not store any data used as a test.

Just have fun and enjoy it.
